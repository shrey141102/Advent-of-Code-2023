# Advent of Code Repository

## About
This repository is dedicated to my participation in the annual Advent of Code event. Advent of Code is a coding event where participants solve daily programming puzzles leading up to December 25th. The event consists of various challenges that test problem-solving skills and programming proficiency.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized to include solutions and explanations for each day's puzzle. Each day is contained in a separate directory, labeled by the corresponding day number.

### Example Directory Structure
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ day-01
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ challenge1.txt
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ answer2.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ answer1.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ challenge2.txt
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

- **`challenge.txt`:** Contains the puzzle input for the day.
- **`answer.py`:** Contains the Python code solving the puzzle.
- **`README.md`:** Provides a detailed explanation of the puzzle and the solution.

## How to Use
Feel free to explore the repository and review the solutions for each day. Each day's README.md file contains a description of the puzzle, the provided input, and the Python code used to solve it.
